# Chatter

Chatter is an encrypted chat server that allows for secure communication and the passing of files via the server.

Chatter functions in two roles: **client** and **server**.

### Server
The Chatter server is the foundation. Ideally, it is run on a machine and left to manage the chat. It will ask for the IP address to listen on and a shared secret.

### Client
The Chatter client allows for connection to the Chatter server. Clients can chat, upload, and download files as needed.

Currently, there are rudimentary server commands that can be used.
